        </ul>
        
        <h1>Steps</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, <br>
                and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally,<br>
                until lightly browned but still soft, about 5 minutes.<br>
                Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.
            </li>
            <li>Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Coat a large baking dish or cast iron skillet with 1 tablespoon olive oil. </li>
            <li>Arrange lemon slices in a single layer on the bottom of the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Stir remaining 5 tablespoons olive oil, lemon juice, <br>
                garlic, kosher salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl.</li>
            <li>Toss Brussels sprouts in lemon juice mixture to coat; <br>
                transfer to the prepared baking dish with a slotted spoon,
                draining excess liquid back into the bowl.</li>
            <li>Place bacon on top of the Brussels sprouts.</li>
            <li>Toss potatoes in the same lemon juice mixture used for the Brussels sprouts.</li>
            <li>Remove potatoes with slotted spoon and arrange along the inside edge of the baking dish.</li>
            <li>Coat chicken breast halves thoroughly in the remaining lemon mixture</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts skin-side up in the skillet; pour any remaining lemon juice mixture over chicken.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until chicken no longer pink at the bone <br>
                and the juices run clear, about 60 minutes. <br>
                Aninstant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        </ol>
