    <h1>Steps</h1>
      <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). <br>
            Prick potatoes with a fork. Transfer to a 10x15-inch baking pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, turning once, until tender, about 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, for chili, add ground beef, <br>
            onion, and garlic to a large saucepan. Cook over medium heat, <br>
            stirring to break
        up lumps, until meat is browned and onion is tender, about 10 minutes. Drain grease.</li>
        <li>Add tomato sauce, chili beans, <br>
            and chili seasoning mix to saucepan. <br>
            Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer,
        covered, at least 10 minutes to let flavors meld.</li>
        <li>When potatoes are cool enough to handle, <br>
            use a spoon to scoop potato pulp into large bowl. <br>
            (You should have about 4 cups pulp). Discard skins. Add broth to bowl. Mash potatoes until smooth.</li>
        <li>Melt butter in a 4- to 5-quart Dutch oven over medium heat.<br>
             Stir in flour and cook, whisking constantly to make a light<br>
        roux, about 2 minutes. Gradually whisk in milk, 1 cup at a time.<br>
         Cook, whisking constantly, until lightly thickened.<br>
        Stir in potato mixture, buttermilk, salt, and pepper.<br>
         Cook, stirring frequently, until heated through, <br>
         3 to 5 minutes(soup will be very thick).<br>
          Remove from heat and gradually stir in 1 cup cheese.</li>
        <li>Divide soup among bowls. Top with chili, sour cream, <br>
            remaining 1/2 cup cheese, and chives (if using).</li>
      </ol>
